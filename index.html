<h1>Julia Seng-Sourinho</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Julia Seng-Sourinho was born in Montpellier, France and currently lives in New York City where she is pursuing a major in Journalism + Design at The New School. </p>
<p> She spends an indecent amount of time watching Netflix – her favorite show at the moment is The West Wing – and the Academy Awards have quite literally become her Super Bowl. One day, she hopes to walk the Dolby Theatre stage herself and accept the award for Best Original Screenplay. Until then, she contents herself with learning as much as she can.
Outside of classes, she can be found walking along the Hudson River Greenway. On most days she will be alone, but on lucky ones she will be in the company of friends.</p>
